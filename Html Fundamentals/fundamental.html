                <h2><b>Subjects of study</b></h2>
                <p>At the Awesome Science Fcaulty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall 
                    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
                    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ides you submitted we were most intrigued
                    by are as follows, in order of priority; 
                </p>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol &#40;C<sub>14</sub>H
                        <sub>12</sub>O<sub>3.</sub>&#41;</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on the performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#176;C  &#40;86&#176;F&#41;,
                    when the audience size exponentially increases &#40;effect of 3&#215;10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3&#215;10<sup>4</sup>.&#41;</li>
                    <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, 
                    and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</p>

                <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

                <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exoyic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance
                    <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influencial dance back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around 
                        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestocks to be "fruitful".</dd>
                </dt>   
                
                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle
                    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which 
                        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly 
                    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired 
                modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                </dt> 

                <dt>Arctic robot dance
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
                        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
                        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like Thisbecause they were really cold.
